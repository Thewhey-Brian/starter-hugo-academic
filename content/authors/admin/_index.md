Xinyu (Brian) Guo is a Ph.D. student in [Computational Biology and Bioinformatics](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu/) at University of Southern California. He received his ScM in [Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) at Johns Hopkins University in 2022, adviced by Prof. Nilanjan Chatterjee and Prof. Hongkai Ji. He received his BA in [Mathematics](https://math.wustl.edu/) at Washington University in St. Louis in 2020, adviced by Prof. Todd Kuffner.

His research interests include statistical genetics integration, genomics data analysis, and natural language processing in genome sequencing data. Specifically, he focuses on developing robust statistical methods, integrating GWAS data with multi-omics data such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq.

His current research project:

* Accuratelly identify cell cycle phases from scRNA-seq data
* Integrate genetics information with scATAC-seq data
* Indentify transcriptional and epigenetic regulators which mediate hormone-driven cancer tumor resistance to therapeutics
